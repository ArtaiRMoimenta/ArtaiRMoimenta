# 📚 How to Create a GitHub Portfolio

Hi, I'm Katie! 🙋🏻‍♀️ This is a **fuss-free** guide to create your GitHub portfolio. 

It's perfect for
- Beginners in data science looking to showcase samples of work, or projects.
- Serves as a digital resume to demonstrate your technical skills. 
- A fun way to track of your projects.

**Why I created this repo?**
- I used to find GitHub intimidating. When I first signed up in March 2021, I didn't understand how it worked and ended up leaving it aside. 
- However, since then, I've become quite obsessed with writing in Markdowns 😆 and have learned how to use it. Now, I'm excited to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂
